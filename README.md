##### Dear User!

##### Before running the application, use the the following command to install the necessary modules:

> pip install requirements.txt

##### As a first user, the app will make a config.json.

##### This file includes your user name, database name, email address /as a sender/ and password. Please, do not make any mistake during inserting these data elements.

##### If it happens, modify them manually in config.json, otherwise you get an error all the time.

##### Thank you for your attention!
