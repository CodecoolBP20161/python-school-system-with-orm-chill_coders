##### Dear User!

##### Before running the application,
    1. make a simple text file,
    2. save it as 'db_config.txt',
    3. put it into the same folder, where the application runs.

##### The file should include the next 2 personal piece of datas in separate rows:

    my_database_name
    my_user_name

##### Example:

    TW_ORM_week7
    janedoe



##### This file is ultimately going to be ignored by Git.

##### Thank you for your contribution!
